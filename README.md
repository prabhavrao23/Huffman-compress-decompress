## Huffman (Owen L. Astrachan) Encoding/Decoding by Prabhav Rao 

What program does:

Huffman compression achieved up to a 42.1% space reduction.

Example:
enitre Moby Dick book. (MOBY-DICK.txt)

1247kb - original size

722kb - compressed file

1247kb - decompressed file

1. Ask the user if they want to compress or decompress a file.  
2. Get input file path.
3. Get a path to save the new compressed or decompressed file.
4. And then exit.

I have included Images of how to use the program using the text files included in the REPO
